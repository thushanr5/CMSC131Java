Types of loops: 
1) While loop 
2) Do while loop: Has at least one iteration because do goes before reaching the while 
3) For loop: For x amount of iterations do this... 
4) For each loop: Iterating through arrays or arraylists 

Break exits a loop 
Continue skips an iteration of a loop to the next itereation 
Continue and break can only be used inside of a loop or a switch statement 

Examples of each loop: 
1) while(true){ //do 
  this... }
  
2) do
{ 
//Cooking and cleaning
}
while(true); 

3) for(int x = 0; x<10; x++)
{ 
System.out.println(x);
}

4) for(int el : arr)
{ 
System.out.println(el);
}
