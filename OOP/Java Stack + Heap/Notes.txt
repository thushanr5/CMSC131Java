1)When running computer, there are two memory locations: 1: Stack, 2: Heap

Stack elimnates containers when finished compiling it such after compiling a method

2)Stack -> Container of containers, each function has its own memory location and each variable has its own memory location within a container

3)Heap -> Stores memory address for every function and variable
Example: Car myCar = new Car();  myCar doesn't actually hold myCar but rather myCar refers/points to the car object created in memory

4)Garbage collectino is a proccess that runs in the heap and looks for variables that don't get pointed to and eliminates them to save space in memory

5)Instance variable is a variable that belongs to a particular instance and its state can be modified

Summary Example:

class Engine{
Car myCar = new Car();
Engine bigEngine = new Engine();
myCar.bigEngine -> Refers to the memory adress of big engine
}

class Car{
  int hp;
  Engine myEngine;

}
